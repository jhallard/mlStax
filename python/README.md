mlStax in Python
================

This is the top level directory for the python implementation of mlStax. In `mlstax_np` is an older version that relies only on numpy and does use theano, `mlstax` is the new version.

Right now there is some simple testing code in the `tests` directory but not much, I'll be adding some actual good unit tests later.

This project provides 3 similarly-structured deep-learning libraries, in the Python, C++, and Haskell programming languages. The user creates ML models by stacking customizable layers on top of one another. The user can then train the custom model over arbitrary data-sets, and if satisfied, use that model for predictive purposes. 

I do plan on adding in CUDA bindings for each library, but that's definitely for v.2.
